Welcome to ComputeShadersExperiment, a Godot project dedicated to exploring the capabilities of compute shaders!

_PS: While there isn't a video showcasing the project due to performance issues during recording, the images below provide a glimpse of what the project accomplishes._

## Download üì•
You can either download the repo or clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yunusey/ComputeShadersExperiment.git
cd MultiplayerExperiment
```

Once downloaded, import it into the Godot editor to get started!

## What is it? ü§î
ComputeShadersExperiment simulates a solar system (as depicted in the images). It's based on [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation), where each particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Implementing this system requires calculating interactions between multiple planets and the sun. As the number of planets (N) increases, the complexity rises with O(N^2) iterations needed for calculations. While CPU-based computations face limitations due to concurrent processing, GPU execution (simultaneous processing) offers an advantage, which we explore through this project. Resources like **NekotoArts**'s [Raytracing in Godot 4](https://github.com/nekotogd/Raytracing_Godot4/) and [video on compute shaders in Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueUMr92GQJc) are great for delving deeper into compute shaders in Godot.
